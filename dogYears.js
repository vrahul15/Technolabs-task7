// 1. Create a variable named myAge, and set it equal to your age as a number.

// 2. Create a variable named earlyYears and save the value 2 to it.
let earlyYears = 2; // The first two years of a dog's life.

// 3. Multiply earlyYears by 10.5 to get the dog years for the first two years.
earlyYears *= 10.5; // Each of the first two years counts as 10.5 dog years.

// 4. Subtract 2 from myAge to get the later years.

// 5. Multiply laterYears by 4 to get the dog years for the later years.

// 6. (Optional) Print earlyYears and laterYears to check values.
console.log(earlyYears); // Should be 21 if myAge >= 2

// 7. Add earlyYears and laterYears to get total dog years.
let myAgeInDogYears = earlyYears + laterYears; // Total age in dog years.

// 8. Use .toLowerCase() on your name and store in myName.

// 9. Print the final sentence using string interpolation.
console.log(`My name is ${myName}. I am ${myAge} years old in human years which is ${myAgeInDogYears} years old in dog years.`); // Displays the result.
