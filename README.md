# 🐶 Dog Years Calculator

Ever wondered how old you’d be if you were a dog?  
This fun JavaScript project converts your age from human years to dog years using a simple formula!

---

## 🚀 How It Works

- **First 2 years:** Each counts as **10.5 dog years**
- **Every year after:** Each counts as **4 dog years**

The program calculates your "dog age" and prints a friendly message with your name and ages.

## 📝 Usage

1. **Edit your age:**  
   Open `dogYears.js` and set your age in the `myAge` variable.

2. **Run the script:**  
   Open your terminal and run:
   ```
   node dogYears.js
   ```

3. **See the result:**  
   The console will show your name (in lowercase), your human age, and your age in dog years!
